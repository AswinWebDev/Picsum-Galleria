# Picsum Galleria

This React app is created using Vite and is designed to generate images based on a specified count value.

## Functionality

The app allows the user to input a count value (e.g. 10) and will generate that many images. For example, if the count value is 10, the app will generate 10 images.

## Styling

The app is styled using Bootstrap, a popular front-end library for building responsive and mobile-first web pages. This helps ensure a consistent and visually appealing user experience across different screen sizes and devices.

## Usage

To run the app, simply clone or download the repository and run the appropriate commands in your terminal or command line interface to install dependencies and start the development server. For more information on how to use Vite, refer to the official documentation.
